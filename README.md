## Releases

Paladin currently has two release streams:

- `main` - this is where stable releases are available, with regular releases occurring at least once per month
- `v1-develop` - tracking some large upgrades that are planned as part of a V1.0 release

The primary themes for the upcoming V1.0 release are:
- Upgrades to the orchestration engine to support advanced features such as M of N endorsement policies for privacy groups
- Additional standardization of the token interfaces across notarized and ZKP backed tokens
