# Example: Storage with Privacy Groups

See the [tutorial](https://lf-decentralized-trust-labs.github.io/paladin/head/tutorials/private-storage/) for a detailed explanation.

## Pre-requisites

Run the common [setup steps](../README.md) before running the example.

## Running the example

### Option 1 - `npm` with downloaded solidity contracts

- **Extract contracts**

  - Extract the `abis.tar.gz` file that was downloaded in the [setup steps](../README.md) and copy the `abis` directory to `src/`. (full path should be: `paladin/example/privacy-storage/src/abis`)

- **Run the example**

  ```shell
  cd <paladin-root>/example/privacy-storage
  npm install
  npm run start
  ```

---

### Option 2 - `npm` with locally built solidity contracts and ABIs

- **Run the example**

  ```shell
  cd <paladin-root>/example/privacy-storage
  npm install
  npm run abi
  npm run start
  ```

5. **(Optional) Run the update example**

You can update the contract deployed in the previous step using the `update.js` sample. Take the output from the `npm run start` step above and pass the privacy group address, group ID, and storage contract address to the `update` script. E.g. if the output from the first script looks like this:

```shell
Creating a privacy group for Node1 and Node2...
Success! address: 0xb9473d084800cdf8c4526a117fa153ad2261d94e
Privacy group created, ID: 0x09be3a466f0c935f42e9aa0451574b639497f2c4d38dee41fdabf9fc2269af08
Deploying a smart contract to the privacy group...
Contract deployed successfully! Address: 0xe5ccd796c1d3e2cf9230fd51f4333208dabfdf80
```

then pass the following parameters in to the update script:

```shell
npm run update 0xb9473d084800cdf8c4526a117fa153ad2261d94e 0x09be3a466f0c935f42e9aa0451574b639497f2c4d38dee41fdabf9fc2269af08 0xe5ccd796c1d3e2cf9230fd51f4333208dabfdf80
```

The script reads the current value and sets it to a new one.

---

### Option 3 - Run with Gradle

- **Run the gradle build task, then run the sample:**

  ```shell
  cd <paladin-root>/example/privacy-storage
  ../../gradlew build
  npm run start
  ```

**(Optional) Run the update example**

You can update the contract deployed in the previous step using the `update.js` sample. Take the output from the `npm run start` step above and pass the privacy group address, group ID, and storage contract address to the `update` script. E.g. if the output from the first script looks like this:

```shell
Creating a privacy group for Node1 and Node2...
Success! address: 0xb9473d084800cdf8c4526a117fa153ad2261d94e
Privacy group created, ID: 0x09be3a466f0c935f42e9aa0451574b639497f2c4d38dee41fdabf9fc2269af08
Deploying a smart contract to the privacy group...
Contract deployed successfully! Address: 0xe5ccd796c1d3e2cf9230fd51f4333208dabfdf80
```

then pass the following parameters in to the update script:

```shell
npm run update 0xb9473d084800cdf8c4526a117fa153ad2261d94e 0x09be3a466f0c935f42e9aa0451574b639497f2c4d38dee41fdabf9fc2269af08 0xe5ccd796c1d3e2cf9230fd51f4333208dabfdf80
```

The script reads the current value and sets it to a new one.
